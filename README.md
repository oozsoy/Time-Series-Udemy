### Time Series Analysis, Forecasting and Machine Learning
--------

This repository contains Python notebook files that contain tutorials and projects based on a Udemy course (by Lazyprogrammer) which I strongly recommend if you would like to enter to the world of time-series forecasting. 
Notebooks dwell on many useful basic time-series analysis methods such as ETS, ARIMA, VARMA, Prophet commonly used in industry applications, as well as GARCH and Deep Learning methods (ANNs, CNNs, RNNs) for financial time series applications. 

In conjunction with the lectures, the files can be followed in this order: 

1. Time_Series_Basics
2. ETS_Methods
3. ARIMA
4. VARMA
5. ML_Methods_for_TS_Fcasting
6. DL_TS_ANN
7. DL_TS_CNN
8. DL_TS_RNN
9. GARCH_TS
10. Prophet_TS
